# UniversityManagement
A mini-project in C Data Structures

<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<h3>OBJECTIVE:</h3>
The main objective of this project is to function as Interface between a University
and its students.
<h3>WORKING:</h3>
This project performs the basic operations that an official university website does.
It has all the details embedded in the files. All the data in the file is converted into
a Binary Search Tree. This project has many methods that are built using the basic
operations on a binary search tree. One has to opt for the operation he wants the
code to perform. After every modification, the user makes, it is reflected back in
the files and he could even verify them.

<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h3>2.1</h3>
In this project we have demonstrated few operations that take place in an official
college website. One can check his details, pay the exam fee or even quit the
college. New entries are also possible.
We have a University and few colleges under it and the details stored in
files. Firstly, you have to select the college and the corresponding tree is created.
Now you can get your details by just giving your roll number(search operation on
a bst) if you are a student in that college. If you want to join the college you have
to enter your credentials, a roll number will be generated automatically(new node
insertion in the bst and corresponding file). You can check your fee payment
status and pay it if it is unpaid(updating in the bst and file). You can also quit the
college(deletion in the bst and file).
<h3>2.2 Concepts Used:</h3>
Operations on Binary Search Trees and Files, sorting and searching.
<h3>2.3 Data Structure Used:</h3>
Binary Search Trees, Linked Lists, Arrays
<h3>2.4 Language Used:</h3>
C Language
